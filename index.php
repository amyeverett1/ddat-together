<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/JdR_Tech">Jacqueline de Rojas</a></h3>
    
<div class="text">
    <p>Jacqueline is the President of techUK and sits as a Non-Executive Director on the board of UK technology business Rightmove plc. Serving as a member of the government's Digital Economy Council, Jacqueline is also a mentor to boards and executives through Bird &amp; Co.</p>

 <p>Her presidency focuses on the ambition for the UK to seize its position as a digital nation of significance by leveraging its digital opportunity and skills. She believes that to achieve this all geographies and demographics across the UK must be included and we must strive to equip our country with the very best infrastructure and supportive business legislation possible. Above all, none of the above can be achieved unless the UK tech industry demonstrates that it is open for business to global markets.</p>

 <p>Prior to her presidency, Jacqueline held the role of deputy president techUK and board champion for women. She has used this role to leverage resources in the technology industry to support her manifesto to increase diversity of skills and talent in the tech industry. This has gathered increasing momentum through techUK's Women in Tech Council, which continues to bring industry together to drive for inclusion, diversity &amp; gender equality.</p>

 <p>Jacqueline has been employed throughout her career by global blue-chip software companies to accelerate growth by pulling amazing teams together which can operate under pressure and extend their reach through smart partnerships.</p> 

 <p>Jacqueline was previously a Non-Executive Director at Home Retail Group plc; is currently a board advisor to Digital Leaders, Accelerate-HER and lends her support to everywoman. This year, Jacqueline was listed as one of Europe's Inspiring Fifty Role Models. In 2016 she was listed on Debretts 2016 500 Digital People of Influence and entered the @Computerweekly Hall of Fame as the most influential woman in UK IT; she was voted Computer Weekly's Most Influential Woman in UK IT in 2015. She was recently appointed as a special advisor to the Girlguiding Association for technology transformation.</p>

<div class="text">
             <p>Tom Read is currently Chief Digital and Information Officer at Ministry of Justice. He says: My career has focused on technology as an agent of change and growth. In short, how organisations can bring digital into their core to make things better, faster and more profitable.</p>

<p>I have worked across banking, media, and most recently government as a Deputy Director at the Government Digital Service and as CTO at the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>My successes so far have been built on a few key beliefs. Firstly that everything we do should start with the user: from deciding what laptop to provision to designing a digital service, the user needs to be at the centre of every decision. Secondly that people can do amazing things and will love change if you include them in every decision. Thirdly, that things don't need to be nearly this complicated in the digital and technology space: start small, iterate and use simple language to describe what you're doing. </p>
